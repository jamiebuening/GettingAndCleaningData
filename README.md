Getting and Cleaning Data
=========================

This is a repository for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data project.  

Within the respository are the following files:
* **CodeBook.md** - The Code Book for the project work.  This describes the transformations made to the original data, provided information about the output tidy data, and also describes the variables in the tidy data.
* **README.md** - Describes the repository purpose and provides information on each file.
* **run_analysis.R** - This is the R script used to process the original data in order to merge, clean, and describe the output data.
* **sub_act_avgs.txt** - File that contains the output from the run_analysis.R script.  This is the tidy data set as described in the CodeBook.md file.
